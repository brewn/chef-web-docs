Platforms and Supported Versions
================================

[[edit on
GitHub]](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/platforms.rst)

Chef software is supported on the various operating systems (platforms)
listed below. To see which versions of our software we currently
support, see the versions section.

Platforms
---------

The sections below list the platforms that Chef Software Inc. supports.
Support is divided into two levels:

-   **Commercial Support** consists of the platforms that are supported
    as part of a paid commercial support contract with Chef Software
    Inc.
-   **Community Support** is made up of platforms for which support is
    only available through the Chef community

Any platforms or versions not explicitly listed here are unsupported,
both commercially and by the community.

Commercial support generally follows Chef community support policies,
which track the lifecycle policies of the underlying operating system
vendor.

In all cases (beyond community support), a maintenance contract with
Chef Software Inc. is required in order to open support tickets and get
SLA-based assistance from our support desk.

Platform End-of-Life Policy
---------------------------

Chef's products on particular platforms and versions generally reach
end-of-life on the same date as the vendor EOL milestone for that
operating systems. Because different vendors use different terminology,
the following table clarifies when Chef products are end-of-life
according to those vendors' terms:

Supported Versions
------------------

This section lists the versions of the OSS and commercial Chef products
we currently support as well as the support level (expressed as a
lifecycle status) for each product. The lifecycle status defines the
involvement by Chef Software in updating and maintaining each product in
the list below.

### Lifecycle Definitions

This stage indicates that an application or version is in active
development or is considered feature complete.

-   Chef continues to provide releases to the application or version in
    response to customer needs and security vulnerabilities
-   Chef welcomes customer feature requests for the product roadmap for
    the application

**Deprecated**

This stage indicates that an application or version is no longer in
active development and will eventually move to end of life status. Chef
continues to provide support [according to our
SLAs](https://www.chef.io/service-level-agreement/).

-   Chef no longer provides scheduled releases
-   Customers should use the GA alternative to these products; contact
    us for help with product selection and deployment
-   Chef may provide a release for a critical defect or security
    vulnerability

**End of Life (EOL)**

This stage indicates that Chef has set a date after which the
application or version will no longer be supported or recommended for
use by customers.

-   As of the end of life date, the application will no longer be
    supported by Chef and will no longer be available for download
-   Documentation for the application will be moved to
    <https://docs-archive.chef.io>
